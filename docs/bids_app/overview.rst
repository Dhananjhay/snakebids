Overview
========

Snakebids apps are defined by a config file (``snakebids.yml``) that specifies which files from a BIDS dataset should be used as input, and the workflow definitions (in one or more Snakefile(s)) that define how to process those input files.

A snakebids app containing this structure can be created using `this cookiecutter template <https://github.com/akhanf/snakebids-app>`_.
